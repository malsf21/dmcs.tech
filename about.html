    <h2>Digital Media</h2>
    <p>
      Digital Media is all about creating beautiful things that beautiful people see on beautiful screens. Throughout the year, we'll learn how to make awesome websites, front-ends, some Illustrator and Photoshop work, as well as how to tie all of that together to make a rocking online portfolio.

    <h2>Computer Science</h2>
    <p>
      Computer Science, quite literally, is professional problem solving. During the year, we'll explore how to solve problems using these super powerful and awesome machines called computers: whether it be as simple as responding to a question, or as complex as mapping out a path for a delivery man.
