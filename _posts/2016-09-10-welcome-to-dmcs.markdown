As clubs fair draws to a close, we'd like to welcome you to the Digital Media and Computer Science Club. Over the next 10 months, we'll be exploring ways to express yourself with computers: the Digital Media side, which includes website design, front-end development, and making as many things pretty as possible; and the Computer Science side, where you'll learn how to solve problems creatively, and a long the way pick up a few neat skills. It's definitely going to be super exciting, and we hope you'll be able to join us.

As for our schedule, we meet on every Tuesday and Thursday, at Lunch, in room 304. During each meeting, we'll split up into DM and CS, and occasionally have both combined together. We'll have many different meeting types: sometimes, we'll have lectures, and other times we'll have time to work on challenges. And of course, you're welcome to bring lunch. Can't deny you that!

We're extremely excited to start another year of DMCS Club. Our first meeting is on Tuesday, September 20th, in Room 304. We'll be there. Will you?
