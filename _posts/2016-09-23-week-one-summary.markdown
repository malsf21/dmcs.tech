Hey guys, it's Matt here! We've wrapped up our first week of DMCS club, and it was an awesome start to the club! Here's what we did this week:

## Intro to HTML (Tuesday)

We went over the very basics of what HTML is: a simple "markup" language that lets you make your text pretty. We created a `.html` file, typed some text into it, and used the `<p>` and `<h1>` tags to style our text. In addition, we figured out how to use the [Thimble Editor](https://thimble.mozilla.org/en-US/edtior/) to edit HTML, and see some live previews.

## Intro to Javascript (Thursday)

We [installed node](https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.5.0/node-v4.5.0.pkg), and used it (hint hint, type in `node` in your Terminal) to learn about basic programming structures. We:

* Printed things to our console using `console.log("Hello world!");`
* Set variables to equal values e.g. `var box = 4;` or `var mattslife = "nonexistent";`
* Called on variables using `console.log();` e.g. `console.log(mattslife);` would output "nonexistent"

If you'd like to learn more, we have awesome resources in the [DMCS Resources tab]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/) for you to check out! In addition, coming to more club meetings will let you learn more about these awesome topics. See you next club!
